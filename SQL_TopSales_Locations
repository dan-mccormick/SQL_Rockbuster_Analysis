This query is used to determine the 10 countries with the most Rockbuster customers. In order to create the query several inner joins are necessary to link the customer table to the 
country table. 

 SELECT D.country, COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
   FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
  GROUP BY D.country
  ORDER BY customer_count DESC
  LIMIT 10;

This query uses the results from the previous query to give the top 10 cities by customer count for Rockbuster within the top 10 countries. Again, several inner joins are 
used to join the customer table to the city table. A WHERE clause is used to specify which countries to include the query. 

 SELECT C.city, COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count
   FROM customer A
  INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
  INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
  INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id=D.country_id
  WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil','Russian Federation', 'Philippines', 
                      'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
  GROUP BY C.city
  ORDER BY customer_count DESC
  LIMIT 10;

This query used the results from the previous query to give the top 5 customers by total spend from within the top 10 cities. Again, several inner joins and a WHERE clause are used. 

 SELECT C.customer_id, C.first_name, C.last_name, F.country, E.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
   FROM payment A
  INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
  INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
  INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
  INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
  INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
  WHERE E.city IN ('Aurora', 'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 'Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 
                   'Zalantun', 'Rio Claro', 'Tokat')
  GROUP BY C.customer_id, F.country, E.city
  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
  LIMIT 5;
