In this query, the goal is to find the average amount spent by the top 5 customers by amount from a specific group of 10 cities. 
To do this, a common table expression with the name top_5_cte is used to find the top 5 customers from the group of 10 cities. 
Then the rest of the query finds the average of the amount paid by the customers from the CTE.  

WITH top_5_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid) AS
     (SELECT C.customer_id, C.first_name, C.last_name, F.country, E.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
        FROM payment A
       INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
       INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
       INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
       INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
       INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
       WHERE E.city IN ('Aurora','Shimoga','Aparecida de Goinia','Emeishan', 'Pontianak','Tarsus','Atlixco',
                        'Zalantun','Rio Claro','Tokat')
       GROUP BY C.customer_id, F.country, E.city
       ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
       LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid)
  FROM top_5_cte;


In this query, the goal is to find the total amount of customers in each country, as well as how many of the top 5 customers by amount spent 
from a group of 10 cities are in each country. To achieve this, a common table expression with the name top_5_cte_v2 was used. The query within 
the CTE finds the top 5 customers by amount spent from the 10 cities. Then the main portion of the query lists all of the countries in the database, 
the total customer count for each country, and then a count of how many of the top 5 customers from the CTE are from that country. 
Then the total is ordered by total customer count.


WITH top_5_cte_v2 (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city, total_amount_paid) AS
     (SELECT C.customer_id, C.first_name, C.last_name, F.country, E.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
        FROM payment A
       INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
       INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
       INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
       INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
       INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
       WHERE E.city IN ('Aurora', 'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 'Tarsus', 
                        'Atlixco', 'Zalantun', 'Rio Claro', 'Tokat')
       GROUP BY C.customer_id, F.country, E.city
       ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
       LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country AS country, COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT(top_5_cte_v2.customer_id) 
       AS top_customer_count
  FROM customer A
 INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
 INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
 INNER JOIN country D ON c.country_ID = D.country_ID
  LEFT JOIN top_5_cte_v2 ON A.customer_id = top_5_cte_v2.customer_id
 GROUP BY D.country
 ORDER BY all_customer_count desc;
