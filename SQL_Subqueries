In this query, the goal is to find the average amount spent by the top 5 customers by amount spent from a specific group of cities. To do this, a subquery with 
the alias “total_amount_paid” is used. In the subquery, the top 5 customers from the 10 cities are found. Then the subquery is nested in the outer query, which 
is used to calculate the average amount spent by those top 5 customers. 

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid.total_amount_paid) AS average
  FROM 
       (SELECT C.customer_id, C.first_name, C.last_name, F.country, E.city, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
          FROM payment A
         INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
         INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
         INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
         INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
         INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
         WHERE E.city IN ('Aurora', 'Shimoga', 'Aparecida de Goinia', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak','Tarsus', 'Atlixco', 'Zalantun', 
                          'Rio Claro', 'Tokat')
         GROUP BY C.customer_id, F.country, E.city
         ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
         LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid;

In this query, the goal is to find the total amount of customers in each country, as well as how many of the top 5 customers by amount spent from a group of 
10 cities are in each country. The first step is to use the query from the previous step which found the top 5 customers as a subquery. This subquery will have 
an alias of “top_5_cust”. Then create an outer query which will join to the subquery using a FULL JOIN on the customer_id column. This outer query will then select 
each country in the country table, count how many total customers there are in that country, and then count the total number of top 5 customers from the 
subquery that are from that country. The final results will then be ordered by total customer count.   

SELECT D.country AS country, COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, COUNT(top_5_cust.customer_id) 
       AS top_customer_count
  FROM customer A
 INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
 INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
 INNER JOIN country D ON c.country_ID = D.country_ID
  FULL JOIN (SELECT C.customer_id, C.first_name, C.last_name, F.country, E.city, SUM(A.amount) 
                    AS total_amount_paid
               FROM payment A
              INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
              INNER JOIN customer C ON B.customer_id = C.customer_id
              INNER JOIN address D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
              INNER JOIN city E ON D.city_id = E.city_id
              INNER JOIN country F ON E.country_id = F.country_id
              WHERE E.city IN ('Aurora','Shimoga','Aparecida de Goinia', 'Emeishan', 'Pontianak', 'Tarsus', 
                               'Atlixco', 'Zalantun', 'Rio Claro', 'Tokat')
              GROUP BY C.customer_id, F.country, E.city
              ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
              LIMIT 5) AS top_5_cust ON A.customer_id = top_5_cust.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count desc;
